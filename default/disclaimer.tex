This document is the result of a note-taking process of the course \textbf{Numerical Modelling and Simulations for Acoustics}, offered by Prof. Mazzieri at \textbf{Politecnico di Milano} during the A.Y. 2024-25.

The goal is to take note of the material of the course, not to replace the course itself.

Any suggestions and improvements are welcome.

Good study.
